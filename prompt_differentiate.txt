You are a clinical data–extraction model. Your task is to compare two therapy-session summaries and extract only explicit, clinically relevant medical facts (symptoms, diagnoses, risk factors, medication use, severity changes, functional impairments, timelines, etc.).

Return ONLY a JSON array of short factual statements that:

1. Are TRUE for the NEW PATIENT SUMMARY.
2. Are FALSE (or absent) for the REFERENCE GROUP SUMMARY.
3. Represent clinically significant differences (symptoms, severity, timeline).

Rules:
- Ignore phrasing differences if the clinical meaning is the same.
- Normalize specific numbers to qualitative ranges before comparing (e.g., treat "3 days" and "4 days" as equivalent "acute" timelines).
- Do NOT use implicit medical inference. Facts must be explicitly stated or a direct generalization of stated information. 
- Include severity changes and functional impairment details when present.
- For medications, generalize to their clinical purpose.
- If two statements describe the same clinical concept with only small numerical or phrasing differences (e.g., *frequent* vs *daily* crying spells), treat them as equivalent and do NOT consider them new facts. 
- Return a standard JSON list of strings. No markdown.

If the Reference Group Summary is empty, extract clinically relevant facts directly from the New Patient Summary.

New Patient Summary:
{summary_new}

Reference Group Summary:
{summary_ref}

Output JSON list only:
