  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Um, well, definitely not in my family life, because my parents don't really condone-"

    "utterance_text": "Yes."

    "utterance_text": "Uh-huh. Anything else?"

    "interlocutor": "client",

  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay. So, it's-- It sounds like you're actually pretty comfortable with setting a goal of not drinking anymore a-at least at the next part? and seeing how it goes."

    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah."
  },

  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Oh, that's a great question. So, a lot of times, kids who are trying to cut back, it's harder if their friends are still drinking, and one of the easiest things is trying to have more activities that don't involve alcohol, but-"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Okay, yeah."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "-of course, that's harder if you're not the one planning. So, some of the things that can be useful if you're at a party say, um, and there's already alcohol there, and there are other kids that maybe aren't your closest friends, um, some of the things that I would recommend since you're interested are, you know, carrying around a different drink that looks like it has alcohol in it. So, you know, even carrying an empty beer bottle or beer can or, you know, if people are having a mixed drink, just having the coke, say-"

    "utterance_text": "Yeah, that's a good idea."

    "utterance_text": "Yeah, for sure."

    "interlocutor": "therapist",

    "interlocutor": "client",
