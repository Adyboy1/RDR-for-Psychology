    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Well, as I think you know, Methamphetamine use is associated with some health risks. And the amount that you're using it-it puts you in a category that we consider a risky user. And that contrasts with someone who it says addicted, um, someone who's a heavy user but it's not in a healthy category because people who use Methamphetamine tend to run to a number of consequences. And actually one of them is, um, sexually transmitted diseases. Do you suppose that your STD might be associated with your Methamphetamine use?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah, it could be because, uh, I was high when I had unprotected sex and I would not do that if I were not high."

    "utterance_text": "No, I mean, no. I mean, like I said, I only do it in clubs, you know, with my friends, uh, two or three times a month at-at the most. Um, uh, I don't think it's really having other impacts. But I'm-I'm concerned about this one. I never expected to get gonorrhea."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah, you know, I'm concerned bout it too and I'd actually recommend that you stop using Methamphetamine altogether. And, um, there-there are a lot of reasons for this but that's-that's would be my recommendation."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "I-I understand but it's I think that would be a hard thing for me to do. You know, I mean, I know I should but, I mean, that's like my whole social life. You know, I mean, all my friends go to these clubs. That's where- that's where I see them. You know, that's my sex life basically and, uh, meth is just- it's just a part of it. You know, I mean, everyone is doing it there. You know, so it's while I would like to stop it's-it's kind of hard to think about doing that right away."

    "interlocutor": "therapist",

  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",

  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "I mean, this has been really uncomfortable, you know, gonorrhea is a really bad experience. And, uM, I know I don't think the same, you know, when I'm- when I'm on it. And, uh, I mean, what I have is bad enough, I could easily get AIDS. I could get HIV the same way. So that scares me a lot. That's why it's higher than a one or two."

    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Well, I do just snort it but you don't know what it's cut with, you know, there could be something, you know. It could be really bad, um, if it was cut with something dangerous or something. I mean, I-I worry about that sometimes."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Mm, so when I was first talking to you, I thought that you'd have a very, um, really not much interest in not stoping using Methamphetamine but it sounds like you have a number of reasons why you really would like to stop using Methamphetamine. And that is, um, that it might be cut with something else, um, you could get another ST- STD including HIV."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah."

    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "I haven't really talked to her about it. I think she knows it I do it sometimes. I mean, we're pretty close. I think I could talk to her about it, and I think she would probably help."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "So on the one hand, it would be difficult to quit using Methamphetamine because there are so many positives that you get from using it. But on the other, there are reasons why you want to quit using methamphetamine."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yes."
  },

    "interlocutor": "therapist",

    "utterance_text": "Yes."

    "utterance_text": "Okay."
