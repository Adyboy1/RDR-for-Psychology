Well, I think, Barbara, having-having heard your story, and heard about the symptoms, I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you. And the reason for that is because you've-you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years, and-and they've not shown anything. And your symptoms haven't really changed that much. So it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that-that they'd show anything different than what we already know.
