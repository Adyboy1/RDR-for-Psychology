    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Mm-hmm. So what's the- what's the-- Say, if you get on the course-"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah."

  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "-and, um, you're, like, real good with, uh, hands-on stuff, but the stuff around the manuals, and the assignments, and those sorts of things, um, don't feel so good. What-what do you think we need to do around helping you with that?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Well, um-- Well, I don't know. Hopefully, there's not so much of that stuff. Um, oh, well, I don't know. I could find out maybe someone who can help you, like, at the school, at the polytech, maybe somebody can help you out and stuff, or there might be computers there or something."

    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Not really fitting in. It kind of just gets in the way."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",

    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah? So, what temptations have you had to, kind of, go back to offending?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Like like getting on the piss, but with Donna, there kind of keeps me busy."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Mm. So the drinking is something that we talked about can make it easier for you to offend."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "So you've noticed that when you've been drinking that those feelings are coming back again, or?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah. I just wanna have a bit of a laugh and like go smash some windows or go and nick a car or something, but yeah. It's kind of harder to think straight."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "It's harder to think straight when you've been drinking?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah. Yeah. And so you've got Donna around at the moment?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "And that's helping keep you in check, as you said?"

  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah. What would happen if she wasn't around say or at a party or?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "I'd probably just go be stupid with my mates."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay. So Donna at the moment who kind of being there is like a strength?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah. 'Cause if there's just like if a mate said they're gonna go out and pick a car or something, she just bumps them out and then-then I don't know. She say that's stupid and stuff. And I don't know. It gives me something to do."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Mm. What do you think?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Just kind of stupid. Well, it's pointless, but still a bit of a laugh."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Mm. Yeah. 'Cause I was thinking about that dream that you've got about the job and a life with Donna and-"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Mm."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "-kids and stuff like that and how you were saying that the offending doesn't fit in with that dream or that idea."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "No."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "So there's that on the one hand, but on the other hand, there's the kind of immediate, um, feeling when you've had a few to drink and you're with your mates and it feels like it would be a bit of a laugh?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "So you've got-got those two things going on at the same time. Yeah?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Mm."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "And it sounds like sometimes when you're in there with your mates and had a few drinks, it's hard to hold on to that vision of the future."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah. You don't really think about that. Well, just in the moment."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay. So what-wh-- in the moment, what are you thinking?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Just have a bit of fun. Not really thinking."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Not really thinking or simply not thinking beyond the next-"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Mm."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "-kind of minute or so-"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "No. Just, like, it's not normally my idea, like someone else would just suggest it and you kind of just, yeah."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "So it's not your idea. And you also go along with it?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah. You can't really be like, \"Oh no,\" just give me shit."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Mm-hmm. What would happen if you say no?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Just like, it can be shit and I still do it. They just-just call me a pussy or whatever and I don't know. And they'd talk me into it probably."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Mm-hmm. So it's hard to actually say no to your friends-"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "-'cause of what they- what they thought of you."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "They'd just think I was joking, yeah."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah. So I'm wondering what the-the thinking, 'cause, um, one of the things that's really changed for you is being with Donna."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "So I'm wondering, you know, most of them butt-butts head on your friendships with those- with those guys."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "I don't see them as much, but like she gets along with them aye, so-"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Mm-hmm."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "I don't think, like, I am not sure they like it."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Then so when you're-- so you're spending less time with them and more time with Donna?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah. And you're saying you're kind of hanging out with her and going to movies and stuff? Yeah. And that means you're spending less time with your-- with those people that have actually led you in trouble in the past?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "They don't lead me into trouble. But-"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay. So tell me- tell me what it is that they do so I get a better understanding of it."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Uh, like it's my choice though, they don't make me."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah. I know it's just having grown up with, it's just what we've always done."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay. So that's just what you've always done."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "But we're also talking about this idea that it doesn't fit with what your goals are or what your hopes are?"
  },

    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Mm."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah. Mm. How would you like it to be?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "My life? Well, what do you mean?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Mm, well the stuff about when you're in the moment. Yeah."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "When you've had a few drinks and you kind of go and get into trouble. How would you like that to be different?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "I don't know. Just more or less like if Donna was there and maybe if my mates got some girlfriends or something like that would calm them down too."

    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Mm-hmm."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "So just hang out instead of go and do stuff, like stupid stuff."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay. So-so Donna's helped calm you down and you'd like, um, them to calm down too?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah, 'cause then we could hang out together and stuff-"

    "interlocutor": "client",

    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "So am I hearing that it's tricky in some ways to hang out with them sometimes-"

    "utterance_text": "Yeah."

    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "-now that you're with Donna?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah. Cause I like I feel guilty not spending my time with, yeah, Donna. Like, I miss my mates, like, I get lonely and stuff, but even though they get me into trouble, but-"

    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Hmm."
