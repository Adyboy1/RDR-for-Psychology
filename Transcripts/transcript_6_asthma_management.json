    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",

  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "That's pretty shocking to be told that you have to get rid of your dog."

  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah. Yeah, it's- it's a big stress, it's like my best friend, so that's one of the important things. Also, I guess, cutting down these last cigarettes I've been working on."

  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay, so smoking and-and I'm working towards quitting completely sounds like that's a goal for you?"

    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay, wow. So there's a lot happening right now, Sal. Anything else that that's concerning you?"
  },

    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "No. It's just overwhelming when you see them everything they're, you know?"

    "utterance_text": "Right. Well, so where would you-- I mean, if you-you had to pick somewhere, one or two kind of high priorities or-or things to talk about in our time this morning, where would you wanna start?"

    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "I think- I think the thoughts about the dog has been definitely bothering me, that's been one."

    "utterance_text": "Okay."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "And, um, my-my asthma is out of control too. So maybe those two."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay, and those are ones that are pretty related to each other-"

    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Mm-hmm."
