I wondered if you had a minute to talk to me. I just want to make sure that you know how best to take it, and if you have any questions."

    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Sure. I'm just getting a few groceries."

    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay. What did the doctor tell you cholesterol statin is for?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Well, he told me that I had a blood test for cholesterol, and that I should start taking this."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "He's right. This medicine is designed to help lower your cholesterol, and that means that it will help lower your risk of having a heart attack or a stroke. How did your doctor tell you to take this medicine?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "He didn't really tell me. He just phoned it in."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay. Well, you're going to take one tablet of cholesterol statin 20 one time a day by mouth, and you can take that with or without food. When do you normally take your medications?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Well, I take all of my other medications right before I go to bed. So I guess I could take it then."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay. That's perfect because cholesterol statin works best if it's taken at night, though you can take it any time of the day. And you should take it every single day. It's important to keep that up. Where do you store your medications?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "I store my medications, uh, in my nightstand, right by my bed."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "All right. Do you have any children in your home?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "No."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay. Well, then that sounds like a perfect location for you. Medicines keep best if they're stored away from light and heat and moisture. What did the doctor tell you to expect in terms of side effects?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "He didn't mention anything about that."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "All right. Well, this medication is pretty well tolerated, which means it doesn't have very many side effects. But you might experience some mild muscle aches and pains. If they seem really severe to you, then you should call Dr. Ferris and talk to him about that. Also this medicine can interact with a lot of other medications, and even over the counter things. So check with the doctor or myself before you start anything new. And lastly, grapefruit juice can interact with cholesterol statin 20. So if you use grapefruit juice every day, I probably would switch to a different juice while you're on this medication."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Just so I know we're on the same page, can you repeat back to me how you'll take this medicine?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Sure. I'm just gonna take one tablet right before I go to bed with my other medications. And I guess I will switched to orange juice. And if I notice any muscle pain that is severe, I'll call Dr. Ferris right away."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Great, Kaylie. I know we went over a lot today. What other questions do you have for me?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Uh, I think you answered all my questions. Thank you."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Fantastic. All right. Well, here's your prescription. I even put it on auto fill for you so that it will be filled for you every- at the same time every month. And if you have any other questions later, our phone number is right here on the bottle, and you can call me at any time. Thanks so much. Have a great day."
