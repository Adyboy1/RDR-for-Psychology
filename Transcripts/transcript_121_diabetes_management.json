    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Right. Okay."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Because its genes or the-the-the-the hereditary factor is not the only factor that causes it or is involved in it happening to you. So there's other factors that come into play."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "I'm sure you're going to tell me what they are."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Well, you've-you've mentioned some of the things you know, and one of those is hereditary factors. You mentioned that the doctor mentioned that. And what else do you know or have you heard? You say you haven't had a lot of time to do the research. What else? Other things you've."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "To be frank, Mark, I honestly don't know. I mean, I honestly don't know what causes it because I've never had any reason. It came upon me from the GP and it took me back."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Um, the hereditary thing I thought, well, maybe that's the explanation."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "That makes a bit of sense."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",

  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Well."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "If that would help."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "If there's something that you think that-- Yes. Yes, of course."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Well, I'll perhaps share with you what I know from working with other people and some of the things I've experienced in working with people."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Okay."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "And see what you make of it. See if it fits a little bit more with where you're at. We know that there is a strong family factor or hereditary factor, so that's one aspect. So also it tends to happen a little bit later in life, rather than something you might get when you're a teenager, this type of diabetes. So-so it's a later onset. It takes a bit of time for it to develop maybe. And the main reason I think, um, the main aspect of it is that it, have you heard about insulin."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "I've heard of it yeah."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "So that's a hormone or a chemical, it allows you to utilize sugar in your body."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Right."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "All right. And Type II diabetes typically people have a resistance or a resistance to insulin in their cells, in their fat cells or their muscle cells or liver cells. They can't use insulin. And so sugar builds up in your system."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Are you saying that they-they like they can't digest insulin or is that?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "You need insulin in your cells, individual cells in muscle or in fat or wherever to, um, use up excess sugar or to utilize sugar."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Oh, I see. So-so it's like a-it's like a balance."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "That's right."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "So insulin you-you."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Kind of, as your."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "You have yourself draws bar."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Yap."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Or something, and then what balances that out in the body is the insulin taking off the excess."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Or-or digesting? Should I say the excessive sugars?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "That's a good way to think."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Is that what happened?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Exactly. And what's happening in Type II diabetes is your-your fat cells and liver cells and muscle cells are resistant to insulin. It's almost like they're saying we can't use that."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Why?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "And if-- Well, there's a number of-- We're not entirely sure, there's a lot of research still going on as to how this happens and how that could be modified. But what we do know is that, um, one of the key things in managing it is to try and modify or modulate, control the amount of sugar that are in your system."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Right. Okay."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah. So there's a couple of things that we know that people with Type II diabetes have to look after and have to think about if they want to control the amount of sugar that's in their system, which is the main issue that's causing some of the health problems that people have with Type II diabetes. Too much sugar, and if it's not able to be utilized in the blood cell, in the fat cells, or liver cells, and the muscle cells stays in your bloodstream. And that can cause problems with your circulation. So too high blood sugar and too low a blood sugar can be a problem. So sugar is the main concern in Type II- Type II diabetes.And you mentioned earlier on, a couple of things that the doctor-- You've mentioned some signs that he was kind of a little bit concerned about. Well, what things did you notice over the-over the last month or so?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "You mean, personally?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Well, I didn't know. I mean, the thing is you see that-- I mean, I did think about this a little bit and I thought, well, over time, if things happen slowly, you don't really notice."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "As you get older."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah."

And-and we've also talked a bit about what's going to happen next. And you've come up with some great ideas. What I hear you saying is that, you know, before all this, before you met the GP, things are going fine.Well, as you would of-- As, you know, as you'd seen it, you were just doing your thing, and getting on working, and being busy, and being successful, and then suddenly this diagnosis, this doctor tells you that you've got a problem."
