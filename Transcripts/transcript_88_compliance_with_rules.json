Because what we will do is we will monitor you and we'll check in 30 days to see how you're going with your goals. So with that being said, we want you to pick something that is relevant for you, something that you're willing to work on. So with that being said, is there anything that you would like to change your work on either at home or school, um, [unintelligible 00:00:30]?"

    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "So it's almost like you want your mom to make it say that this is for you. It's not because your mom's making you get up like you want your mom to remind you, \"Hey, remember, this is something that you want for yourself is to be in time for first-hour class\"."

    "utterance_text": "Absolutely."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "So what I've been hearing so far- what again, what a great goal. You've already had some insight of how to do this. So for you, it's really important that you're getting to your first hour because you don't want to go back to sanction days. You don't having- like having all these extra people checking up on you and all those things.You've already have a plan of going to bed by 11:00, turning off the lights, putting your cell phone away. Even the support of your mom is really gonna be helpful for you, um, getting up at 6:15 in the morning with that alarm. I know that seems really early in the morning, but you seem willing to do it. And if you're not able to do it, your mom's gonna help you out as well."
