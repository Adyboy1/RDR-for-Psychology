    "utterance_text": "Here's the part where I share information. The safest level of drinking for teenagers is zero drinks. That's because we know a number of negative things are more likely to happen when adolescents drink. We know alcohol can harm how the brain develops as an adolescent and teens who drink are more likely to hurt themselves by accident. Sexual assault is another thing more likely to happen and so are sexually transmitted diseases. I'm curious, do you think your drinking has anything to do what the possibility of having an STD?"

  },

    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "There's something else I wanna share. When people forget where they are or how many drinks they've had, that's a sign of heavy drinking. And when people keep drinking despite experiencing negative consequences, that can be a sign of what we call alcohol use disorder."

    "interlocutor": "client",

  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",

    "utterance_text": "Um, a nine."
  },

  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Well, I really don't want any STDs and I don't like wondering whether I have one or not."
  },

  },

  },

    "utterance_text": "Well, I have this friend who thinks I drink too much. She would probably be willing to make me promise not to have more than two drinks at a party."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay. And how about unprotected sex? It sounds like you don't want to experience that again."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "I'm going to talk with him and I'm gonna make him promise that we always use a condom and that we don't have sex drunk."

  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "All right. So, you're very motivated to change your drinking and you have a plan to keep from drinking more than two drinks at parties and keep from having unprotected sex. I would like to share how it's working for you. What do you think about coming back in six weeks or so?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
