    "utterance_text": "Yeah. What do you think it'd be like for your kids if they were sitting here now and they heard you say that this was really, really important to you and to them? That you gave this program 100%. Well, then what might that be like for them to hear that?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Um, I-I-I'd hope that they'd be proud of me. I wouldn't want my kids to see me- to see me here though. But I- But I hope they would be proud of me."

  },

    "utterance_text": "Yeah, I hope so. I-- So I would genuinely want to, I genuinely want to do something to help myself. I don't deliberately fuck things up for myself."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah. So you and I are going to be doing a little bit of work together then. And, um, and sometimes it-it can get quite tough. And I'm just wondering before we go any further, when the going gets tough, a lot of guys bail out. I'm just wondering are you one of those guys?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "No, this is important to me."

    "utterance_text": "I have, um, I've-- it's important to me."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Good. One of the other things we're really conscious of with is, um, sometimes we do this work in isolation from others. And one of the things we want to ask people is about who they're going to be accountable to. I'm thinking like with your children, uh, your mom and other people that maybe you're interacting with. Who-who else in your life do you think would be supportive of you, and who would you need to let them know that you're actually going through this sort of program?"

  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Right. In terms of your employer, would they be supportive?"
  },

    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Uh, yeah, I don't know. Maybe, but I don't know if I want them to know though."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay. What do you think it might be like for you to explore that with them?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Uh, I don't know."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Any other family members that, uh, live close that, uh, you think would be supportive?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "I'm pretty much by myself up here."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay. The reason why I'm asking this, Rick, is just, um, you know, part of, um, uh, being responsible is turning up and doing the program."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Mm-hmm."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "The other aspect of that is kind of like who we're going to be accountable to while we're doing the program. So one of the- one of the challenges, one of the riddle I'm going to put in front of you is like who else can we get involved to support you while you're going through this?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Um, I don't know. I don't, um, have that many people-"

  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "-that I am-- I don't have that many people I trust to support me. My mates, I love them but, um, yeah, I don't know."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay. So as we're gonna do this work together and go through this, uh, this program, one of the things we-we don't want to do is fall into the same trough we did last time. So I-I just want to leave that with you to think about next time we come together. There may be two or three other people that you think of that can be really supportive, that we-we need to let know that you're [unintelligible 00:10:50] each gonna make these changes and this time, you're serious about it. So let your mother and, uh, and, um, your partner, how might that happen? How does that sound to you?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah, let's give it some thought."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Rick, I get a sense that you're kind of padding this walk a little bit on your own at the moment. Would that be true?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah. That'll definitely be true."
  },
