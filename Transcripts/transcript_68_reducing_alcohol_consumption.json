    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "The days that we drink are mostly, like I said, they're parties, so it's more of that whole partying and dancing and, you know, having everyone have fun.

  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",

    "utterance_text": "Definitely."
  },

    "interlocutor": "therapist",

    "interlocutor": "client",

    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Um, it's, you know, when we drink, we-we tend to have more fun because I guess we're not, you know, everyone's drinking together. We're a lot more loosened up and relaxed-"

    "utterance_text": "Mm-hmm."

  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay. So sort of in the-the too much drinking or-or at times, can you tell me some of the less good things or not so good things about alcohol?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Um, a lot of times, it'll make- it'll make people stupid. [laughs] Yeah, you know, people make dumb decisions and things like that. We-we usually try to be as safe about it"

    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Mm-hmm."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "-as possible. So we'll like sleep over at a friend's house. And so that, you know, we're not driving and it's mostly within our friend group. So we're not worried about strangers putting weird things in our drinks."

  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Mm-hmm."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "But, um, definitely some of the ideas people can have when they're stup- when they're drunk and can be really stupid."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Mm-hmm. So you're trying to, like you said, not engage in really dangerous activities?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "You're trying to stay put, you're not driving. You're trying to stay with people that you trust. Um, but yet it sounds like there's still some-some things happening from time to time."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Sometimes. Yeah."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Can you tell me a little bit about that?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Well, I, especially don't like it whenever me or one of my friends, like we drink too much and we end up like throwing up or things like that, that I don't- that's not fun."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah. Throwing up is never fun."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "It's not."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "And how often do you think that happens?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "For me, that's happened to me once. It was the first time I ever drunk and it was- it was a lot, I didn't know what I was doing. I was mixing all kinds of weird things and just kind of taking anything everyone- anyone gave me"

    "interlocutor": "therapist",

  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "But after that, I haven't- but I do have friends that still do sometimes, so I'll end up like having to take care of them or something and-"

  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "It kind of puts a downer on my- on my fun."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Uh-huh. Okay. So, on the one side, some of the fun things associated with alcohol are people are just more relaxed, sorta, um, carefree can kind of let loose a little bit more, on-on the other hand, there's a little bit more, I guess, planning involved-"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "-because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can. And then, um, there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it's not you, that sometimes you're stuck your-your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck dealing with a friend who drunk too much. Okay. And the other not so good things about the alcohol?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah. People can get a little like sloppy, I guess. Like they're all loose, like with people in corners doing things that should be done in private-"

    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Mm-hmm."

    "interlocutor": "client",

    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "So you're kind of stuck being exposed to things you don't need to see."

    "utterance_text": "Yeah."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Got it. Okay. Um, all right. Well, you mentioned a couple of times that you've made a few decisions to try and limit the dangerous aspect of the drinking. Why did you make those decisions?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "I just- I've, you know, I have an aunt who is an alcoholic. So I-I see like the issues that are involved and I've seen movies and things I know that drunk driving is an issue-"

    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Mm-hmm."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "So, I, you know, I wanna be as safe as possible in those terms and be in a setting where like we can let loose but still be safe like in someone's house or sort of my parents will tell me something. But-- So, I- like I know that there are dangers involved and I guess I wanna limit that."

  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",

    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",

    "utterance_text": "Then it kind of defeats the purpose? [laughs]"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Right. And then with the respect, one of the things you mentioned, is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundaries, not sort of cross lines."

    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah."
  },

    "interlocutor": "therapist",

  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "I think, well in a way, I do think that drinking is probably a form of disrespect to my own body because I'm not putting things- I'm putting things in it that shouldn't be there."

  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "And then-- But in terms of at- how it is I am respecting myself, I am- I'm respecting myself by like trying to stay in someone's house and like trying to limit my drinking so I don't get to that blackout like throwing up and everything."

  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "I usually-- Well, I start off like I make sure that I make my own drink so I know what's in it and how much is in it. So in that way I control how much I drink. So, I usually just, you know, get one of those cups and then make one drink. And then I'll try to make it last as long as possible. And I'll be like, \"All right, this is my one drink\" and I'm good in that way. I still have something in my cup so people aren't gonna be like, \"Oh, here. Have some more.\" I'd be like, \"No, I'm good. I have mine,\" and I'll still be, you know, having some to like let loose a little."

I have- You know, I still have something. I'll get some later.\" And I never end up getting anything. Oh, but sometimes they'll be like, \"Hey, let's take a shot,\" and everyone's gathered around like the kitchen or something ready to take a shot. And then at that point, I'll be like, \"Oh, well, maybe I can take one more.\" And that's when I start, you know, falling into-"

Especially going to med school like I know how things affect your body and also affect your-your social and your school work and things like. I know that once I get to college, it's not- it's not gonna-gonna work out being, you know, drinking every weekend and then like trying to wake up early and go to school, take an exam. Like I know that's not- that's not feasible. It's not a good idea."

    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay. And so you mentioned the- you know, quite a few reasons why you would like to cut down. Um, have you thought at all about how you might go about doing that?"

  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Um, I'm thinking of maybe like trying to convince my friends without sounding, you know, dorky or something and be like, hey, you know, let's just stay in today. Like, let's not go out or something. Or just be like, hey, I'm not like-- I'm not going to drink today. And then even if my friends do, like being okay with them, drinking around me and not doing it, and then them being okay with me drinking-- Me not drinking and them doing whatever they want."

    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah."

    "interlocutor": "therapist",

    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "I think so. I think it's-it's very feasible. I think it's possible."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay. Um, so I guess we'll talk about, um, less alcohol activities. I'm just making some notes to myself and then maybe, um, reducing the amount of drinking that you're doing if alcohol is involved. Okay. Um, so that-that goal sounds feasible, you said? Would it be okay if we met in a couple of weeks to sort of see how it's going?"

    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "I think so. I think that's good."

Well, I really appreciate you spending the time talking to me, you know, it sounds like you have a lot of really good goals for yourself, really ambitious goals of going to medical school and, you know, becoming a psychiatrist or, um, some-some other form of physician. Um, you're really looking forward to doing well in school so you can get there."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "And it sounds like you have a pretty active social life and a-a lot of friends who you feel probably would be, uh, supportive, even if you cut down on alcohol and that, you know, there's a lot of benefits you see both to your body and your health, um, your school performance, and even some of the social stuff in terms of feeling a sense of belonging without having to deal with some of the gross consequences of-of, um, drinking too much."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Um, so yeah, you know, it really sounds to me like you have a good plan in place and as long as you're willing and-and interested in meeting again, I'd be very excited to be able to talk with you about how it's going."
