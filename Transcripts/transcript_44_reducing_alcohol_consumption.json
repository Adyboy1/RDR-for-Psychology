  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Um, it was a good amount. It was the first time I ever drank and it was like three or four cups, but it was mixing different things."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay, so you don't even know."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "So, I'm not-- Yeah."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay. So, and then your friends drink too?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah. Yes. Not all of them, but some of them do."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay. And how much do they typically drink?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "More or less the same amount. So right now the most we'll have is maybe like one cup after that one time, but sometimes one or two, but they can be kind of heavy."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay, so it's one cup, but it's not-not one drink."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Oh, it's a red, you know, typical. Yeah."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",

  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Mm-hmm."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay. Um, so gosh, you're-you're actually really drinking quite a lot. Um, you know, your level of drinking puts you in what we call a high-risk group."

  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Mm-hmm."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",

    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "A little bit."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah. Um, so we call it high-risk because it means that there's actually quite a bit of chances that you're gonna have some bad consequences from drinking like that. So, you know, things like, um, having car accidents, or other accidents, or getting in fights, or, you know, sexual assault, or health problems, or developing alcoholism. Have you thought about those things?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Not too much, to be honest. I-I've always thought since it's, you know, within my small group of friends-"

    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Uh-huh."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",

    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Uh-huh."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "But I haven't really thought about possible alcoholism or anything."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay. So it's, um, so it's good, because you're not drinking and driving, but you're still really drinking a lot. Um, and yeah. Okay. So, let's-let's talk a little bit about that, how you might be able to make some changes. Because I think you really need to- need to stop drinking like this."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Okay."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "So, um, do you think you could quit drinking or?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah, I think I could. I don't need it. For instance, it-it is-- it is used as a kind of, like, let's get the party going."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Uh-huh."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "But we haven't always had it-"

    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Uh-huh."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "-obviously. So, I think it would be possible to stop drinking."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay. So, does that mean you're gonna stop drinking?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Um, I would probably start off by like, because my friends are also involved, so I'd be like, \"Hey, guys, I don't think I'm gonna drink today.\""

    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Uh-huh."

    "utterance_text": "Okay. Um, you don't sound very much like you think that's gonna work."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah. It's, you know, it's one thing to control my own drinking, and it's another thing when everyone else around me is drinking and then there's like that pressure-"

    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Mm-hmm."

    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay. So, how are you gonna quit drinking without your friends thinking you look stupid?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay. Um, so I mean, do you think they're really good friends of yours if they're gonna give you such a hard time?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "My close ones, I know they wouldn't be, you know, have a problem with that. But the ones that I'm not that close with, but I'll still like hang out with-"

    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Uh-huh."

    "utterance_text": "Probably, might be too judgmental."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Mm-hmm. So, um, so I think we should set a goal that you're gonna stop drinking."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Okay."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "And, um, I think you should probably stop as soon as possible, like this weekend."
  },

    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Okay."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Um, so the way this normally works is, you know, we set you a goal, and then I'll have you come back and we'll talk about it again in a couple of weeks and make sure that you actually stopped. Um, and so what do you think about that?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Um, I think-- I think the possibility."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay. So-"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "I think if you make a good plan, like I think I'd be able to follow through with it."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay, great. So, the plan is gonna be that you're gonna quit and, um, the friends that you have that you don't think are supportive, you're just gonna, I guess, not hang out with anymore."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah. I think I can do that."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay. And then, um, you know, like, are your friends in band drinking?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Um, not-not really. The ones that drink more are the ones like my class friends. My band friends, we\u2019re focused on band-"

  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Uh-huh."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "-so I can't really\u2014"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay. So, that might be good, is really just to focus more on band. Um, because you know, the other big concern I have for you is if you wanna go to medical school, you're not ever gonna get into medical school if you're drinking like this."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "You know, like college is gonna be really hard. And especially with all those pre-med classes, you're not gonna be able to handle it drinking this much. You know, have you thought about that?"

    "utterance_text": "Not too much, to be honest."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah. Okay. So, setting this goal then of quitting drinking is gonna be really helpful for you. And um, it sounds like i-it shouldn't be that tough really, um, especially because you can just stop hanging out with-"

  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Mm-hmm."
  },

    "interlocutor": "therapist",

  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Um, what should I-- uh, yeah, I do. So what should I say like once, let's say, I hang out with my friends and they're like, \"Hey, why aren't you- why aren't you drinking?\""

    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Mm-hmm."

    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Well, you know, one good option would be to just review with them review with them all the bad things about alcohol. You can say, you know, \"I thought about it, and I realized it's gonna mess up my schoolwork. And you know, it's really a lot of risk for my health.\" \"I don't want to become an alcoholic.\" Um, you know, \"I don't want to get liver disease.\", \"I don't want to end up driving drunk or getting into accidents-"
