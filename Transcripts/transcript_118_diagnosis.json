So, uh, I think that we should just perhaps go for a bit of paracetamol and, uh, some fluids and let nature sort it out."

Um, but it doesn't alter the fact that you do just have a virus, uh, and they are very common. And the nice thing is that it will get better with paracetamol and fluids, and the paracetamol will help the pain. Um, with giving it to the kids, I'm afraid there's nothing we can do about that. It's unlikely they'll get it, but I can't guarantee it."

    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Uh, well- well, not really. Uh, you need to self-certify in your first seven days off sick so if you're going to take some time off, just take some paracetamol, lots of fluids, get a self-certified note, uh, in to your employer, and put sore throat there."

Perhaps, what you really need to do is, uh, you know, just take some paracetamol and get some fluids."
