  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Just ask to get someone else to do it I guess. I guess I could ask Donna, but it's been embarrassing."

    "utterance_text": "Okay, so you feel like it would be embarrassing to ask Donna to give you some help-"

  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah."
  },

    "interlocutor": "therapist",

  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Hmm. So, who else could you ask to help you?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "No one. I guess you. You could do it. Would you do it?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Well, have you got the forms with you?"

  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "No."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Okay. I'm wondering about-- because it sounds like this whole idea about filling out the forms, is getting in the way of this bigger dream that you've got which is around getting a qualification around something to do with cars-"

  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah."

    "utterance_text": "Yeah."
  },
  {

    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Mm."

  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "I guess, I'd go pick them up and I don't know, I guess I could ask Donna, but she'd probably help me, I don't really want to."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "She'd probably help you, but you don't really want to. It sounds like you're a bit embarrassed."

    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Well, I don't know. Plus, well, I don't know if I could bother getting up at nine o'clock every morning and having to go to Polytec. I've got used to sleeping in."

    "utterance_text": "Yeah."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "-going back to polytech is-- would-would require a really big change in the way which you're currently living, and you're not quite sure if you can do that."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah. Uh, it would be cool if it's anything like school. Like, I didn't really enjoy school. [unintelligible 00:22:56] so writing and stuff, and I wouldn't wanna do that. If it's all hands-on though, it would be all good."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah. So, there's something here about your level of-- about how confident you are around writing or how unconfident you are, that sounds like it's getting in the way."

    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah. No, it does get in the way. I just don't wanna do it."

  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Well, this writing business. What's really getting in the way?"

  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
