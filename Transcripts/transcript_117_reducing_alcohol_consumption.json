    "utterance_text": "Yeah, yeah. So, you've got, you know, some benefits there then, you know. The social element, hanging with friends and-and going out together is something which is-is quite enjoyable. So, it's not a case of removing it completely but it\u2019s a case of, \"Okay, I\u2019m noticing this is impacting on me more than what I\u2019d like to.\" Yeah. Yeah, okay."

I wanna do something about it."

  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah, but I mean, I guess, just talking about it makes me think oh yeah, I need to- I need to do something about it."
