Having said all that, what do you think you wanna do about your pot use?"

    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Mm. So the idea of counseling in your family is for crazy people only and it's looked down upon and the cost would cause a problem too?"

    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Yeah. I just don't see it happening."
  },

    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Katie, we know that many kids come to college and have a lot of stress and deal with a lot of anxiety, and we've also found that when they talk to our counselors and learn specific skills about dealing with anxiety, they do much better. Um, and it's been really successful for a lot of kids. Um, I'm wondering if you think it might be helpful for you?"
  },

    "interlocutor": "client",

    "interlocutor": "therapist",

  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Well, I don't have the money for it so I can't pay for it and my parents wouldn't approve."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Well, the cost is free and the counseling services we provide, we are legally obligated to protect your privacy. We can't tell your parents. There are some exceptions to that privacy rule, including, uh, mostly if we're concerned about- that your safety."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",

    "interlocutor": "therapist",

  },

    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Uh, I would never do that."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "Well, uh, we can go into some more specifics if you decide to see the counselor about what-what privacy rules there are, but for the most part, you wouldn't need to worry about us sharing anything with your parents."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Okay. I guess I'll think about it."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "So, uh, if-if you're walking out now, I can walk out with you and just take you around our counseling center. I can even introduce you to one of the counselors."
  },

    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Do I have to go there?"
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "therapist",
    "utterance_text": "No. No, no. I just wanted to show you where it is and let- make sure you know about our resources here at the college."
  },
  {
    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Okay, sure. I agree, let's go."
