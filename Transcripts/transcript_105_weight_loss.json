    "interlocutor": "client",
    "utterance_text": "Well, I think, uh, when I really start seeing some results at the gym, it's kinda, uh, I think the way it works in my mind is if I've worked out really hard and I've- and I've-- say I've lost a pound that week-"

    "utterance_text": "Mm-hmm."

Um, I'm really-- I'm glad we talked that last time 'cause it-it was the impetus to get me to go the first time in a long, long time."
